# Storyteller's Revenge
This project is part of the Udacity VR Nanodegree program, and is focused on 360 media.  The Storyteller's revenge is my attempt to tell a story with a 360 video using a VR player.  Within the video there are several points at which you can "choose your own destiny" so to speak.  There is also a background track to help set the mood for each scene, and some additional "special effects" in the form of particles falling to represent mist or rain.

## Lessons Learned
Yet another lesson where I learned quite a bit more than I believed I would when I started this project.  For starters, I've become quite familiar with the Unity video player, which is very nice to use and has a lot of built-in features to make playing videos in Unity easier.  Streaming videos via a URL is a little bit of a trade-off, while it keeps the files sizes down, in order to have it stream fast enough, you have to reduce the quality of the video significantly.
